This is my jimmy fallon implementation of semaphores and threads. I have two functions: 
the main function that initializes my threads where the number of threads to create is 
read through a scanf statement. It also initializes the semaphores and all my global var
. It also destroys sem. and joins the threads. In the phonecall method I initialized my 
static vars and my id counter to keep track of their numbers. I have a while loop for my 
sems. and critical conditons. You should expect everyone to get a ticket.
